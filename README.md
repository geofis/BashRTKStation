# BashRTKStation

**Base-rover GNSS-RTK multi-band system, based on the u-blox ZED-F9P receiver, Raspberry Pi and RTKLIB** <br>

## Capabalities

Presently, the Bash scripts have capabilities for:

- Rover:

  - Receive corrections from an NTRIP server and send them to the receiver. Optionally, both the solutions generated by the receiver and the raw observations can be streamed synchronously to TCP + file.
  - Asynchronously receive RTK solutions and raw observations from the receiver, and save them in file(s).
  - Receive raw observations in single mode and stream them to TCP and/or file.
  - Create credentials and define mountpoints.

## Materials

The same materials as described [here](https://github.com/geofis/TouchRTKStation), but replacing the NEO-M8T receivers by ZED-F9P receivers.

## TO-DO list:

- Base:
  - Create workflow for generating base coordinates.
  - Add capabolities for streaming corrections via telemetry and NTRIP protocol.

- Rover:
  - Add capabilities for receiving corrections via telemetry.
